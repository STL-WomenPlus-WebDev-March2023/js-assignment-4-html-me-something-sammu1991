      <h4>
         My First Tasty Mushroom Curry  
      </h4>
      <p>
         Mushrooms are not common in our house kitchen but they are widely used to make many dishes like Biryani, curries etc. If anyone asked me how good I am at cooking I would say “I can manage”. But yesterday night I was so proud of myself for making a yummy mushroom curry. I was so happy and satisfied that my family ate more than what they usually do. They enjoyed it a lot. It felt exactly like when I accomplish my graded assignments on my own. It gave me a lot of motivation to try new dishes in future. I am glad I am able to  share these thoughts in this assignment :).

         I have tried to remember the steps and write it as a recipe. Hope you enjoy.
